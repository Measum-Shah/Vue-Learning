# 🧠 Vue Learning Lab

Welcome to my **Vue.js Learning Repository** – a collection of self-contained Vue starter projects, each focused on mastering one concept at a time. Every subfolder in this repo is a hands-on project teaching a key feature or capability of Vue 3 and its ecosystem (Vue Router, Pinia, Composition API, etc.).
In This I will focus only on compositional api.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure & Topics

Each folder is a complete Vue starter setup:

```
vue-learning/
├── vue-basics/         # Introduction to components, props, events
├── vue-router/         # Routing basics, dynamic routes, navigation guards
├── lifecycle-hooks/    # onMounted, onUpdated, onUnmounted, etc.
├── custom-directives/  # Creating and using custom directives
├── vuex-or-pinia/      # (Optional) State management with Vuex or Pinia
└── README.md           # This file
```

> Each folder is independently runnable using `npm install` + `npm run dev`.

## 🤓 Why This Repo?

I’m building this repo as a **structured Vue learning path** for myself and others who like to learn by doing. Each project is beginner-friendly and focused on just **one concept at a time**.
